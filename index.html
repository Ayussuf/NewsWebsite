        <h3>A Somali Imam is Using Storytelling To Change Society and Political System</h3>
        <img src="./assets/imam.png" alt="imam" width="300" height="200">
        <p>
            Stories matter. People make sense of the world through stories and shape up how we understand it.
            Somalia requires new stories, but people will listen when they themselves are included in the story-line.
            An Imam at a mosque in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, is doing exactly that, offering a new narrative to show what is possible. Sheikh Abdi Hayi is shifting gears and is bringing new ways of telling stories in an unlikely place: a mosque.

        <h4>HIV/Aids infection among youth in Garissa shocking</h4>
        <p>
            The National Aids Control Council (NACC) has raised concern over rising cases of new HIV infection among young people in Garissa County.
            Garissa regional coordinator Wario Boru attributed the growing threat to lack of parental guidance.

            Speaking in Garissa during a HIV and Aids Tribunal workshop that sought to sensitize area residents on their rights of HIV and Aids testing, Boru said that lack of sexual health knowledge coupled with unprotected sex among young people has seen the number of new infections increase in recent days.
            Boru says the county prevalence estimates of 2018 was 0.8% meaning one out of 125 people live with HIV.
            North Eastern is considered the region with highest percentage of HIV stigma in the country due to socio-cultural factors.

        <h3>Wait Until 3</h3>
        <p>Both the national and county governments across Kenya imposed some form of restrictions to fight the virus, but there has been laxity in implementing those directives in Northeastern region. Garissa and Mandera, the two other major towns in the region, are experiencing the same problem. 
           In Mandera, police arrested dozens of wedding goers, and released them without charges.

        <h4>Coronavirus or no coronavirus, Somalia opposition wants election</h4>
        <p>The Forum for National Parties (FNP), an alliance of six political parties, including two parties led by former presidents, Sharif Ahmed and Hassan Mohamud, accused the government of ‘overlooking the urgency of implementing the multi-party system in the country, and interfering in the activities of a joint parliamentary committee on elections, leading to suspension of its work drafting and completion of an electoral law, saying those are tactics to delay the polls.’

        <h4>In Sweden, more Somalis are dying of Coronavirus than any other group</h4>
        <p>
            The virus has been reported in the Jarva area of Stockholm, which includes districts Kista-Rinkeby and Tensta, and around 90 percent of the population coming from an immigrant background.
        </p>
        <p>
            A local doctor suggested the virus may have spread during Friday prayers at a local mosque, but blamed authorities for not spreading information about how the disease is transmitted earlier.
